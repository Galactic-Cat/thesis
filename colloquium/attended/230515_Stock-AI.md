This paper sets out to survey stock market prediction algorithms.
Specifically, the authors wish to focus on deep learning, rather than traditional machine learning.
They also create a novel taxonomy of these deep learning models, in five categories: recurrent neural networks-based models, convolutional neural networks-based models, graph neural networks-based models, transformer-based models, reinforcement learning models, and miscellaneous models.
They then split these categories in even more subcategories.

The paper then visits a list of papers, including their benchmarks, and the evaluation methods they used. 
Finally they also present a list of open questions still lingering in the field.
