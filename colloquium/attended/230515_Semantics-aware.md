This paper presents a novel recommendation framework based on classification algorithms.
They do this by gathering two types of features: classic features, like those based on popularity or content, and extended features which are gathered from the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud.
The LOD cloud is a collection of datasets on all kinds of subjects, gathered in a relational graph.
Important here is that all these datasets can link to items in other datasets, as they follow the same Open Link format.

They test the approach of adding LOD cloud-based features to existing recommendation algorithms on two datasets and find that adding LOD cloud-based features does not only improve the performance of these recommendation algorithms, but also provides an algorithm that can outcompete other state-of-the-art networks.
